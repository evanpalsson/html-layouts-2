		<p><strong>Myth: It's hard to defeat the same team four times in a row, so that benefits Carolina.</strong></p>

		<p>First of all, the two teams who met in October aren't even composed of the same humans -- let alone the teams from 2012 and 2013. Turnover's not just something you put a cherry in.</p>

		<p>Second of all, three of the wins have already been recorded. Winning one game against a team is probabilistically easier than winning four straight. No matter the talent disparity.</p>

		<p>Third of all, that talent disparity exists. If the teams were evenly matched, the myth above would be more convincing. If you start with a coin in hand, the odds are 1 in 16 that it will come up heads four times in a row.</p>
