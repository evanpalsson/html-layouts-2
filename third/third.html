			<pS>SEAHAWKS</pS>

			<p>Did we all get what we wanted? Nope, not on December 25th, but in the aftermath of Carolina tossing aside Arizona last Saturday night. Whichever big cat was headed to Seattle, I sure as hell wanted to see a Panther a-comin' round the mountain. For so long in Dallas last week it looked as though a Golden Lion would swagger back through the gates of the Emerald City this Saturday, warmly welcomed by his once adoring throng, safe in the knowledge that if it wasn't for one Percy Harvin...</p>

			<p>Russell Wilson would have embraced his once most trusted receiver and we in turn would have held our collective breath each and every time Tate touched the pigskin. And here's the thing...my preference was for Seattle to host Carolina this week, yet there I was genuinely made up for Tate when he scampered for the opening score. In addition to that is the plain and simple truth that I will always struggle to root for the Dallas Cowboys, no matter what. That said, I'll be doing exactly the same this week. Oh, the vagaries of thought when it comes to playoff football.</p>

			<p>So, what to think of the defending Super Bowl champions entertaining a team that entered Week 14 armed with a 3-8-1 record? Not that I have any idea of what was on offer, but you probably could've named your own odds at that stage for the Panthers to be visiting Seattle in the divisional round of the playoffs. CenturyLink Field in mid-January was a laughable thought for anybody of a Carolina persuasion as the aforementioned Week 14 saw them head to the Superdome as 9 point underdogs, and all the while having won just one of their previous ten games.</p>

			<p>That last statistic is positively preposterous for a playoff team, but them's the rules and the Panthers did absolutely nothing wrong in winning the weakest division in football since the 2010 NFC West. So, as insipid as the NFC South was this year, Carolina still finished with a better record (7-8-1) than the division-topping Seahawks (7-9) did in 2010. Which brings us on nicely to the not insignificant topic of playoff expansion and, in turn, seeding.</p>

			<p>The NFL's (current) worst kept secret is that each conference will invite a seventh team to its respective playoff party as of 2015 with the added twist of division winners (division champion just doesn't sit right, despite being technically correct) no longer being guaranteed a home playoff game. For what it's worth, I'm dead against playoff expansion, but not an adjustment to playoff seeding if/when expansion is agreed upon. However, if it wasn't for the current format, you can wipe out one of the most defining moments in Seahawks history.</p>
